# Manual acceptance checklist

Steps that cannot be automated on CI (clean installs, real permission prompts,
real hardware, other applications). Each story adds its steps here. Record
results in the PR description as `MA-N: pass/fail — notes`.

## E1-S1 — Project scaffold

**MA-1 Clean checkout builds and tests**
1. `git clone` the repository into a new directory.
2. `make bootstrap` — reports Xcode 27.0 and finds `xcodegen` and `swiftlint`.
3. `make build` — `** BUILD SUCCEEDED **` with no manual Xcode configuration.
4. `make test` — `** TEST SUCCEEDED **`; package, `LemmeTypeTests`, and
   `LemmeTypeUITests` all report results.

**MA-2 Live services launch**
1. `make run`.
2. The status window shows the version, Microphone and Accessibility status
   read from this Mac, and a non-zero input-device count on a Mac with a microphone.
3. No permission prompt appears (status is read, never requested).
